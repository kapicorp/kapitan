# Targets

## Usage

A target is a file that lives under the [`inventory/targets`](#targets) subdirectory, and that tells **Kapitan** what you want it to do for you.

 **Kapitan** will recognise all YAML files in the [`inventory/targets`](#targets) subtree as targets.

!!! note
    Only use **`.yml`** as extension for **Inventory** files. `.yaml` will not be recognised as a valid **Inventory** file.

What you do with a [**target**](#targets) is largely up to you and your setup. Common examples:

* **clusters**: Map each [**target**](#targets) to a cluster, capturing all configurations needed for a given cluster. For instance: `targets/clusters/production-cluster1.yml`
* **applications**: When using **Kapitan** to manage **Kubernetes** applications, you might define a [**target**](#targets) for everything that you would normally deploy in a single namespace, including all its resources, scripts, secrets and documentation. For instance: `targets/mysql.yml`
* **environments**: You might have want to define a different [**target**](#targets) for each environment you have, like `dev.yml`, `test.yml` and `prod.yml`
* **cloud projects**: When working with **Terraform**, it may be convenient to group [**target**](#targets) by cloud project. For instance: `targets/gcp/projects/engineering-prod.yml`.
* **single tenancy**: When deploying a single-tenancy application, you might combine the approaches above, and have a [**target**](#targets) `acme.yml` that is used to define both **Terraform** and **Kubernetes** resources for a given tenant, perhaps also with some **ArgoCD** or **Spinnaker** pipelines to go with it.


!!! example

    If you have configured your kapitan repository like in [Quick Start](/kapitan_overview/#setup-your-repository) instructions, you can run the commands we give during the course of this documentation.

    !!! quote ""

        `kapitan compile`

    ```shell
    Compiled gke-pvm-killer (0.09s)
    Compiled vault (0.18s)
    Compiled pritunl (0.17s)
    Compiled mysql (0.07s)
    Compiled examples (0.25s)
    Compiled postgres-proxy (0.06s)
    Compiled echo-server (0.08s)
    Compiled global (0.05s)
    Compiled tutorial (0.09s)
    Compiled guestbook-argocd (0.08s)
    Compiled sock-shop (0.30s)
    Compiled kapicorp-demo-march (0.04s)
    Compiled kapicorp-project-123 (0.03s)
    Compiled kapicorp-terraform-admin (0.08s)
    Compiled tesoro (0.09s)
    Compiled prod-sockshop (0.34s)
    Compiled dev-sockshop (0.41s)
    Compiled argocd (2.53s)
    ```

    When you run `kapitan compile`, you instruct **Kapitan** to generate for each given [**target**](#targets) a directory under `compiled` with the same name. Under this directory you will find all the files that have been generated by **Kapitan** for that target.

    !!! quote ""

        `tree compiled/mysql/`

    ```shell
    compiled/mysql/
    ├── argocd
    ├── docs
    │   ├── mysql-readme.md
    │   └── README.md
    ├── manifests
    │   ├── mysql-bundle.yml
    │   ├── mysql-config.yml
    │   ├── mysql-namespace.yml
    │   └── mysql-secret.yml
    ├── pre-deploy
    ├── rabbitmq
    ├── scripts
    └── terraform

    7 directories, 6 files
    ```

## Definition

A typical [**target**](#targets) might look like this:

!!! example "`inventory/targets/acme/dev.yaml`"

    ```yaml
    classes:
      - common
      - components.acme.frontend
      - components.acme.backend

    parameters:
      target_name: dev
    ```

Note that it is made of 2 sections:

* `classes` is a list of class files you will want to import.
* `parameters` allows for local override of what is unique to this target.

!!! info

    the `kapitan` key under the root `parameters` is reserved for kapitan usage. Some examples:

    ```yaml
    parameters:
      kapitan:
        compile:      # input types configuration section
        dependencies: # dependencies configuration section to download resources
        secrets:      # secret encryption/decryption configuration section
        validate:     # items which indicate which compiled output to validate
        vars:         # which are also passed down to input types as context
    ```
