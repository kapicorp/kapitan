# :kapitan-logo: **Inventory**

## Overview

The **Inventory** is a core component of Kapitan: this section aims to explain how it works and how to best take advantage of it.

The **Inventory** is a hierarchical `YAML` based structure which you use to capture anything that you want to make available to **Kapitan**, so that it can be passed on to its templating engines.

The first concept to learn about the **Inventory** is the [**target**](#targets). A target is a file, found under the [`inventory/targets`](#targets) substructure, that tells Kapitan what you want to compile. It will usually map to something you want to do with **Kapitan**. 

For instance, you might want to define a [**target**](#targets) for each environment that you want to deploy using **Kapitan**. 

The **Inventory** lets you also define and reuse common configurations through YAML files that are referred to as [**classes**](#classes): by listing classes into [**target**](#targets), their content gets merged together and allows you to compose complex configurations without repetitions.

By combining [**target**](#targets) and [**classes**](#classes), the **Inventory** becomes the SSOT for your whole configuration, and learning how to use it will unleash the real power of **Kapitan**.

!!! info
    The **Kapitan** **Inventory** is based on an open source project called [reclass](https://github.com/kapicorp/reclass) and you can find the full documentation on our Github clone. However we discourage you to look directly at the reclass documentation before you learn more about **Kapitan**, because **Kapitan** uses a fork of reclass and greatly simplifies the reclass experience.

!!! note
    Kapitan enforces very little structure for the **Inventory**, so that you can adapt it to your specific needs: this might be overwhelming at the beginning: don’t worry, we will explain best practice and give guidelines soon.

By default, Kapitan will search for its **Inventory** under [`inventory/classes`](#classes) and [`inventory/targets`](#targets).

## Targets

### Usage

A target is a file that lives under the [`inventory/targets`](#targets) subdirectory, and that tells **Kapitan** what you want it to do for you.

 **Kapitan** will recognise all YAML files in the [`inventory/targets`](#targets) subtree as targets.

!!! note
    Only use **`.yml`** as extension for **Inventory** files. `.yaml` will not be recognised as a valid **Inventory** file.

What you do with a [**target**](#targets) is largely up to you and your setup. Common examples:

* **clusters**: Map each [**target**](#targets) to a cluster, capturing all configurations needed for a given cluster. For instance: `targets/clusters/production-cluster1.yml`
* **applications**: When using **Kapitan** to manage **Kubernetes** applications, you might define a [**target**](#targets) for everything that you would normally deploy in a single namespace, including all its resources, scripts, secrets and documentation. For instance: `targets/mysql.yml`
* **environments**: You might have want to define a different [**target**](#targets) for each environment you have, like `dev.yml`, `test.yml` and `prod.yml`
* **cloud projects**: When working with **Terraform**, it may be convenient to group [**target**](#targets) by cloud project. For instance: `targets/gcp/projects/engineering-prod.yml`.
* **single tenancy**: When deploying a single-tenancy application, you might combine the approaches above, and have a [**target**](#targets) `acme.yml` that is used to define both **Terraform** and **Kubernetes** resources for a given tenant, perhaps also with some **ArgoCD** or **Spinnaker** pipelines to go with it.


!!! example

    If you have configured your kapitan repository like in [Quick Start](/kapitan_overview/#setup-your-repository) instructions, you can run the commands we give during the course of this documentation.

    !!! quote ""

        `kapitan compile`

    ```shell
    Compiled gke-pvm-killer (0.09s)
    Compiled vault (0.18s)
    Compiled pritunl (0.17s)
    Compiled mysql (0.07s)
    Compiled examples (0.25s)
    Compiled postgres-proxy (0.06s)
    Compiled echo-server (0.08s)
    Compiled global (0.05s)
    Compiled tutorial (0.09s)
    Compiled guestbook-argocd (0.08s)
    Compiled sock-shop (0.30s)
    Compiled kapicorp-demo-march (0.04s)
    Compiled kapicorp-project-123 (0.03s)

    Compiled prod-sockshop (0.34s)
    Compiled dev-sockshop (0.41s)
    Compiled argocd (2.53s)
    ```

    When you run `kapitan compile`, you instruct **Kapitan** to generate for each given [**target**](#targets) a directory under `compiled` with the same name. Under this directory you will find all the files that have been generated by **Kapitan** for that target.

    !!! quote ""

        `tree compiled/mysql/`

    ```shell
    compiled/mysql/
    ├── argocd
    ├── docs
    │   ├── mysql-readme.md
    │   └── README.md
    ├── manifests
    │   ├── mysql-bundle.yml
    │   ├── mysql-config.yml
    │   ├── mysql-namespace.yml
    │   └── mysql-secret.yml
    ├── pre-deploy
    ├── rabbitmq
    ├── scripts
    └── terraform

    7 directories, 6 files
    ```

### Definition

A typical [**target**](#targets) might look like this:

!!! example "`inventory/targets/acme/dev.yaml`"

    ```yaml
    classes:
      - common
      - components.acme.frontend
      - components.acme.backend

    parameters:
      target_name: dev
    ```

Note that it is made of 2 sections:

* `classes` is a list of class files you will want to import.
* `parameters` allows for local override of what is unique to this target. 

!!! info

    the `kapitan` key under the root `parameters` is reserved for kapitan usage. Some examples:

    ```yaml
    parameters:
      kapitan:
        compile:      # input types configuration section
        dependencies: # dependencies configuration section to download resources
        secrets:      # secret encryption/decryption configuration section
        validate:     # items which indicate which compiled output to validate
        vars:         # which are also passed down to input types as context
    ```


## Classes

### Usage

The next thing you want to learn about the inventory are [**classes**](#classes). A class is a yaml file containing a fragment of yaml that we want to import and merge into the inventory.

[**Classes**](#classes) are *fragments* of yaml: feature sets, commonalities between targets. [**Classes**](#classes) let you compose your [**Inventory**](/inventory/) from smaller bits, eliminating duplication and exposing all important parameters from a single, logically organised place. As the [**Inventory**](#inventory) lets you reference other parameters in the hierarchy, [**classes**](#classes) become places where you can define something that will then get referenced from another section of the inventory, allowing for composition.

[**Classes**](#classes) are organised under the [`inventory/classes`](#classes) directory substructure. 
They are organised hierarchically in subfolders, and the way they can be imported into a [**target**](#targets) or other [**classes**](#classes) depends on their location relative to the [`inventory/classes`](#classes) directory.


### Importing classes

To import a class from within another file of the [**Inventory**](#inventory), you can follow these instructions:

* take the file path relative to the `inventory/classes/` directory
* remove the `.yml` file extension
* replace `/` with `.`

For example, this will import the class `inventory/classes/applications/sock-shop.yaml`

```yaml
classes:
- applications.sock-shop
```

### Definition

Let's take a look at the `common` class which appears in the example above:

As explained, because the **`common.yaml`** is directly under the **`inventory/classes`** subdirectory, it can be imported directly into a target with:

```yaml
classes:
- common
```

If we open the file, we find another familiar yaml fragment.

!!! example "`inventory/classes/common.yml`"

    ```yaml
    classes:
    - kapitan.common

    parameters:
      namespace: ${target_name}
      target_name: ${_reclass_:name:short}
    ```

Notice that this class includes an import definition for another class, `kapitan.common`. We've already learned this means that kapitan will import a file on disk called `inventory/classes/kapitan/common.yml`

You can also see that in the `parameters` section we now encounter a new syntax which unlocks another powerful inventory feature: *parameters interpolation*!

## Parameters Interpolation

!!! note

    as a shorthand, when we encounter deep yaml structures like the following:

    ```yaml
    parameters:
      components:
        nginx:
          image: nginx:latest
    ``` 

    Usually when we want to talk about the `image` subkey, we normally use either of the following: 
    
      * `parameters.components.nginx.image`
      * `components.nginx.image`

    However, when used in parameter expansion, remember to:
    
      * replace the `.` with `:` 
      * omit the `parameters` initial key which is implied
      * wrap it into the `${}` variable interpolation syntax

    The correct way to reference `parameters.nginx.image` then becomes `${components:nginx:image}`. 

The [**Inventory**](#inventory) allows you to refer to other values defined elsewhere in the structure, using parameter interpolation.

Given the example:

```yaml

parameters:
  cluster:
    location: europe
  
  application:
    location: ${cluster:location}

  namespace: ${target_name}
  target_name: dev
```



Here we tell **Kapitan** that:

* `namespace` should take the same value defined in `target_name`
* `target_name` should take the literal string `dev`
* `application.location` should take the same value as defined in `cluster.location`

It is important to notice that the inventory can refer to values defined in other classes, as long as they are imported by the target. So for instance with the following example

```yaml

classes:
  - project.production

  parameters:
    application:
      location: ${cluster.location}
```

Here in this case `application.location` refers to a value `location` which has been defined elsewhere, perhaps (but not necessarily) in the `project.production` class.

Also notice that the class name (`project.production`) is not in any ways influencing the name or the structed of the yaml it imports into the file

## Advanced Inventory Features


### Target labels

Kapitan allows you to define labels in your inventory, which can then be used to group together targets with similar labels.

For instance you could define the following:

!!! example ""

    Defines a class to add the `customer` label to selected targets

    !!! example "`inventory/classes/type/customer_project.yml`"
        ```yaml
        parameters:
          customer_name: ${target_name} # Defaults to the target_name
          kapitan:
            labels:
              customer: ${customer_name}
        ```

    Apply the class to the target for customer `acme`
    !!! example "`inventory/targets/customers/acme.yml`"

        ```yaml
        classes:
        ...
        - type.customer_project

        parameters:
        ...
        ```

    You can now selectively compile targets for customer `acme` using the following (see see [**Labels**](/website/commands/kapitan_compile/#using-labels) for more details )

    !!! example ""

        ```shell
        kapitan compile -l customer=acme
        Compiled acme (0.06s)
        Compiled acme-documentation (0.09s)
        ```
