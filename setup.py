    This is the only possible way (we found)
    how requirements.txt can be reused in setup.py
    using dependencies from private github repositories.

    Links must be appendend by `-{StringWithAtLeastOneNumber}`
    or something like that, so e.g. `-9231` works as well as
    `1.1.0`. This is ignored by the setuptools, but has to be there.
